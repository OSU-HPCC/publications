	abstractNote = {Temperature response functions, known as g-functions, are a computationally efficient method for simulating ground heat exchangers (GHEs), used with ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems, either as part of a whole-building energy simulation or as part of a dedicated ground heat exchanger design tool. In fact, at present, they are the only feasible way to simulate a ground-source heat pump system in a whole-building energy simulation. This paper summarizes recent developments in the field and recent experience using a new open-source g-function calculation tool known as pygfunction (Cimmino 2018a, 2018b). This experience includes accuracy, computation time, memory requirements and sensitivity to boundary conditions. With larger ground heat exchangers, e.g. in excess of 100 boreholes, the computational time and memory requirements can create challenges.},
