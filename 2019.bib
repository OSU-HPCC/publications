	abstract = {A Bayesian probabilistic modeling platform was used and evaluated for application in a relatively complex individual-tree growth and yield model for coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), which was expressed as a mixed discrete and continuous Bayesian Network for annual projections. The modeling platform used a common and open-source Bayesian analysis program (JAGS v3.3.0), and was sufficiently flexible to handle a relatively complex model structure; namely, a differential form, highly dynamic, recursive, hierarchical, non-linear system of equations with a rather complex error structure. This novel probabilistic modeling platform met certain desirable criteria, including (1) accurate and tractable projections that included full error propagation; (2) flexible and comprehensive analytic capabilities; (3) full consideration of hierarchical and multi-level model structures; (4) capacity for random effects calibration; (5) allowance of hypothesis testing and updating knowledge across different system components, simultaneously with different sources of information (i.e., new data); (6) computational efficiency; and (7) relatively simple implementation as demonstrated in a complied scripting language. Probabilistic projections of forest growth and yield included all sources of errors and uncertainty (e.g., estimated parameters, ...},
