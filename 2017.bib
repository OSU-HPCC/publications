	abstract = {This paper puts forth a modular dynamic subgrid scale modeling framework for large eddy simulation of quasigeostrophic turbulence based on minimizing the errors between structural and functional subgrid scale models. The approximate deconvolution (AD) procedure is used to estimate the free modeling parameters for the eddy viscosity coefficient parameterized in space and time using the Smagorinsky and Leith models. The novel idea here is to estimate the modeling parameters using the AD method rather than the traditionally used test filtering approach. First, a-priori and a-posteriori analyses are presented for solving a canonical homogeneous isotropic decaying turbulence problem. The proposed model is then applied to a wind-driven quasigeostrophic four-gyre ocean circulation problem, which is a standard prototype of more realistic ocean dynamics. Results show that the proposed model captures the quasi-stationary ocean dynamics and provides the time averaged four-gyre circulation patterns. Taking locally resolved flow characteristics into account, the model dynamically provides higher eddy viscosity values for lower resolutions.},

	abstract="Microbial forensics is a scientific discipline devoted to analyzing evidence from a bioterrorist act, biocrime, or inadvertent release of a microorganism/toxin with a goal of attribution (Breeze et al. 2005), linking a pathogen and/or a perpetrator to a specific biocrime or bioterrorst act. Attribution includes identifying the microbe(s) involved (Breeze et al. 2005) as well as those responsible. The components of microbial forensics described by Breeze et al. include (1) detection and identification of a pathogen; (2) bioinformatics, including genome sequencing and genetic databases; (3) strain repositories for pathogens or microbes of interest as well as their near-neighbors; (4) validation and standardization of forensic methods; and (5) rigorous attention to quality assurance steps. Because forensic casework is subject to vigorous challenge in a court of law, the rigor of standardization and validation of experimental, analytical and application methods goes beyond levels that are normal for typical research and management activities.",

abstract="Outbreaks of foodborne illnesses are frequent, but intentional cases are rare. Authorities dealing with suspected intentional foodborne illness outbreaks need a decision support tool to help distinguish accidental or natural outbreaks from intentional cases. Two broad discrimination models are available that cover biological warfare agents but these are not fully relevant to the scale and nature of intentional foodborne illness outbreaks. Two new models are proposed, one involving a scoring system, evaluated on total points, and another based on a Bayesian Network. The Bayesian Network model is more complex, but deals with uncertainty explicitly. The two proposed models are demonstrated by assessing four known outbreaks, two intentional and two accidental.",

These outbreaks are also responsible from thousands of deaths and billions of dollars' worth of damage every year. However it is considered as an essential portion for a healthy diet, the fresh produce, which is contaminated with Human Pathogens on Plants (HPOPs), is one of the major food items causing this damage. E.coli O104:H4 outbreak, occurred in Germany in 2011, has attracted a great attention on foodborne outbreaks caused by contaminated fresh produce, and especially the vulnerabilities and gaps in the foodborne illness surveillance systems. In the frame of this chapter, we focused on the most common foodborne pathogens on fresh produce, epdimiological and traceback investigations of the outbreaks caused by these pathogens in the last 5 years (November 2010--December 2015) in all around the World.",

abstract="Global biosecurity presents international challenges because the majority of instances of novel organism introductions are due to international movements of goods, food and people and the likelihood of introduced agents crossing political boundaries. The inherent vulnerability of environments to introductions of alien, or non-indigenous, biological agents is due to the greater ecological vulnerability to these exotic entrants in the receiving environment. Agencies and individuals responsible for approving intentional introductions of beneficial organisms recognize this relationship and consider potential impacts in risk assessments prior to release of the organisms. However, some of those responsible for detection and control of novel pathogens and pests, introduced either inadvertently or intentionally, lack extensive training in ecology, environmental biology, and pathology, and may therefore underestimate the risk from such events. The latter is a key factor in the case of food safety. Europe is particularly vulnerable to cross-border movement of introduced agents, and one response to this has been the recent revision of plant health regimes throughout the European Union. Other responses include project-based initiatives, such as PLANTFOODSEC.",

	abstract = { Data interpolation/regularization is needed prior to migration and inversion for acquisition with large data gaps. In the last decade, Minimum Weighted Norm Interpolation (MWNI), which is a spectral density based algorithm, has emerged as a powerful interpolation technique. Till date, most of the MWNI demonstrations have been on single component datasets. In this paper we argue that MWNI may be inherently better suited to multicomponent datasets. The underlying assumption is that the vertical component data records both primary and mode-converted energy which, in certain geological conditions, may interfere to create conflicting move-out dips. Consequently, presence of conflicting dips within the interpolation window degrades interpolation. We show that with multicomponent datasets, the wavefield can be decomposed such that one of the decomposed gather is dominated by primary energy and another(s) is/are dominated by mode-converted energy. MWNI of the mode-decomposed gathers lead to better quality results. We have demonstrated this idea on two synthetic datasets, one from a layered model and another from the Marmousi model. Ongoing work tests the application on real data. Presentation Date: Wednesday, September 27, 2017 Start Time: 11:25 AM Location: Exhibit Hall C/D Presentation Type: POSTER },
